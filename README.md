# VJSComponents

##History
When I was creating a webapplication with vanila Java Script I decided to create re-usable Java Script various component classes that can used by anyone with some of the customizability.
##Why?

The people who does not use any framework like react I decided to create JavaScript files with some classes as components to let users to create differrent components to use them within the JavaScript code
